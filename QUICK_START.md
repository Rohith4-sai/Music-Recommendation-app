### 🎯 Key Features Implemented
- ✅ **Hybrid ML Recommendation Engine** (Collaborative + Content-based + Neural)
- ✅ **Bias Reduction Algorithms** (Popularity debiasing, diversity promotion)
- ✅ **Spotify API Integration** (OAuth 2.0, secure authentication)
- ✅ **Context-Aware Recommendations** (mood, time, activity)
- ✅ **Modern Streamlit UI** (responsive, interactive)
- ✅ **Analytics Dashboard** (diversity metrics, user satisfaction)
- ✅ **Search Functionality** (tracks, artists, genres)
- ✅ **Exploration/Exploitation Logic** (novelty vs. familiarity)

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Set Up Spotify API
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Create `.env` file from `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎬 Alternative: Run Demo First
Want to test without setting up Spotify? Run the demo:
```bash
python demo.py
```
